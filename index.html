    <h1>VISUALIZATION COMPARISON</h1>
    <div class="Poor">
      <img alt="Poor Visualization" id="PoorVisualization" src="images/BadVisualization.png"/>
      <p class='PoorParagraph'>This visualization was really poor because there is no credibility to the information presented. Also, the information seems very complex and does not follow Cairo's rule of simplicity. There is little to none interaction happening between the viewer and the visualization, which contributes to its poorness. There is no real beauty being portrayed in the visualization, in-fact it looks like a mess down to its core. This does not expand the island of knowledge because there is not much information provided and it is very lacking of details. This could be better if perhaps the creator had approached it with a different format or perhaps made it more simple.</p>

    <div class="Great">
      <img alt= "Great Visualization" id="GreatVisualization" src="images/GoodVisualization.gif"/>
      <p class='GreatParagraph'>This visualization is really nice because it is simple, is user friendly and clearly contains interactiveness between viewer and data. There is not much background needed to understand the data visualization, it is quiet obvious what each thing is meant to mean. The data is shown in an appealing manner with the use of animations in order to present the data. The credibility of the information being displayed on the visualization can be tested for credibility very simple by looking up what the actual times are of one of the countries and seeing if they match up. It expands our island of knowledge because it helps you gain insight on different time zones around the world and compare them all with a helpful interactive and user-friendly tool. I think this could be improved if the user did not contain the condition of the time zone in a circle, but rather captured it in the background of the box of each. The background could also contain the city in real-time from a camera's live-footage or maybe just an overview picture of the city. Also, perhaps different colors could have made the site more appealing to the viewer and attracted more viewers.</p>
